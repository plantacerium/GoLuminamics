## Execution Plan
1.  **Deployment**: Quickly establish the required unit formation.
2.  **Maneuver**: Execute the movement pattern defined in tactics.
3.  **Fire**: Spam lasers whenever the formation allows.

- **SPEED**: Decision time must be < 100ms.
- **GROUPING**: Calculate moves for groups of stones, not just individuals.
- **AGGRESSION**: If a Laser shot is available, TAKE IT immediately.
