# Playbook: The Laser Master

## Game Mode Configuration
- **Mode**: High Impact Scoring
- **Energy**: Standard / Infinite
- **Score**: Dynamic
- **Grid Size**: All Sizes

## Strategy Overview
**The laser is not just a tool; it is the finality of your strategy. Every stone placed must serve the purpose of creating a path for the laser. A game without firing is a game without points.**

## Core Tactics
- **Laser First**: If a laser action is available and results in point gain or piece capture, prioritize it over stone placement.
- **Setup for Success**: Place prisms and mirrors to extend the reach of your future laser shots.
- **Aggressive Captures**: Use the laser to destroy opponent stones whenever possible. Each capture is a 2-point swing.
- **Territory Locking**: Use the laser to illuminate large areas of the board. Territory only counts when illuminated by your laser.

## Execution Plan
1.  **Preparation Phase**: Place stones to build a network (Prisms for distance, Mirrors for redirection).
2.  **Firing Phase**: Once a network is established, FIRE. Do not wait for the "perfect" setup if a "good" shot is available.
3.  **Iteration**: After firing, evaluate the result. Rotate or add stones to optimize the next shot.

## AI Reasoning Guidelines
- **Always ask**: "Can I fire a laser this turn that increases my score or captures an enemy piece?"
- **If YES**: Do it.
- **If NO**: Place a stone that enables a better shot next turn.
- **Never Pass**: If you have energy and haven't fired, you likely have a move to make.
