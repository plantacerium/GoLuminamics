## Game Mode Configuration
- **Mode**: 100% Territory (Total Domination)
- **Energy**: Infinite
- **Score**: Infinite
- **Time Limit**: 60 Minutes
- **Grid Size**: 39x39

## Strategy Overview
**Focus on creating a massive network of splitters to cover the 39x39 grid.**

## Core Tactics
- Prioritize SPLITTERS to multiply beams.
- Place stones at key triangular intervals.
- Aim to illuminate the center 20x20 area efficiently.

## Execution Plan for 39x39 Grid
1.  **Early Game (0-10 mins)**: Establish the pattern foundation. Do not worry about energy costs.
2.  **Mid Game (10-40 mins)**: Expand the pattern to cover at least 50% of the board.
3.  **Late Game (40-60 mins)**: Hunt down the remaining dark spots to reach 100% territory.

## AI Reasoning Guidelines
- Since Energy is Infinite, prefer placing stones over passing.
- The board is huge. Think in "sectors" rather than individual cells.
- Aggression is viable because replacement is free.
